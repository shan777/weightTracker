Feature list: 
	1) you can add your weight and it sorts automatically in ascending order so you can see all your history.
	2) you can add a short message each day (optional) so you know what you did right and what you did wrong.
	3) it displays a motivational message depending on your weight status (gain/loss/no change).
	4) you can set your target weight so you know how much to work off of.
What I learned from working on this project:

	1) backend (PHP, mySQL)
	2) bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript/jQuery in depth
